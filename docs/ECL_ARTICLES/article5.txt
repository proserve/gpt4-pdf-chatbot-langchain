Equity is a system of law that developed in England alongside the common law. While the common law is based on statutes and judicial decisions, equity is based on principles of fairness, justice, and morality. It is designed to provide remedies for situations where the strict application of the common law would lead to unjust results.The origins of equity can be traced back to the medieval period, when the king's courts were seen as rigid and inflexible. In response, the Court of Chancery was established to provide an alternative source of legal remedies based on equitable principles.Equity is enforced by the Court of Chancery, a separate court system from the common law courts. The Court of Chancery has the power to grant remedies such as injunctions, specific performance, and rescission of contracts, among others. These remedies are designed to provide relief in situations where the common law would not provide an adequate remedy. Some of the key principles of equity include:The principle of conscience: This requires that decisions be made in accordance with principles of fairness and justice.The principle of good faith: This requires that parties act in good faith when entering into contracts or other legal agreements.The principle of proprietary interests: This requires that individuals have a right to protect their property interests, even if they do not have legal title to the property.Overall, equity is an important part of the legal system in many countries around the world. It provides an important source of remedies for situations where the common law would not provide an adequate solution, and it is based on principles of fairness, justice, and morality.Get a head start on your legal education with our First Year LLB Study Guide."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
