The Bill of Rights 1689 is a landmark constitutional document in English history that established certain rights and liberties of individuals, limited the powers of the monarch, and set out the requirements for the succession to the throne. It was passed by the Parliament of England in December 1689 and was signed into law by King William III and Queen Mary II.The Bill of Rights affirmed the rights of individuals to petition the monarch, bear arms, and have a fair and speedy trial by jury. It also established the principle of parliamentary sovereignty and the right to freedom of speech and debate in Parliament. In addition, the Bill of Rights prohibited the monarch from suspending laws passed by Parliament, levying taxes without parliamentary consent, or maintaining a standing army without parliamentary approval.The Bill of Rights was a response to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which saw King James II deposed and replaced by William and Mary. It helped to establish the principle of limited government and the protection of individual rights, and has been an influential document in the development of constitutional law in many countries around the world.Get a head start on your legal education with our First Year LLB Study Guide."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
