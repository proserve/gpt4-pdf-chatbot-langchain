Constitutional statutes are those laws that form the constitutional framework of a country. These statutes are often considered to be the most important laws in a legal system, as they establish the rules and principles that govern the exercise of governmental power and the relationship between the state and its citizens.Constitutional statutes typically address fundamental issues such as the structure of government, the distribution of powers between different branches of government, the rights and freedoms of citizens, and the procedures for amending the constitution. They are often entrenched in a country's legal system and are therefore difficult to amend or repeal.Examples of constitutional statutes include the United States Constitution, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the Human Rights Act 1998 in the United Kingdom. These statutes are typically given a special status and are interpreted by courts in a particular way due to their fundamental importance in the legal system.Get a head start on your legal education with our First Year LLB Study Guide."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
