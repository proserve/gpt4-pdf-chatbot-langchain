English law is a legal system that has evolved over centuries, and it has a number of key features that distinguish it from other legal systems. Some of the key features of English law include:Common Law: English law is based on the common law tradition, which means that legal principles are developed by judges through their decisions in court cases. These principles are then applied in future cases that have similar facts and circumstances.Precedent: The common law system also relies on the principle of precedent, which means that judges are bound by the decisions of higher courts. This creates a consistent and predictable legal system.Statute Law: In addition to common law, English law also includes statute law. Statutes are laws passed by Parliament, and they can override common law principles.Separation of Powers: The English legal system is based on the separation of powers between the judiciary, the executive, and the legislature. This helps to ensure that no one branch of government has too much power.Unwritten Constitution: Unlike many other countries, the UK does not have a written constitution. Instead, the constitution is made up of various laws, conventions, and traditions that have developed over time.Trial by Jury: In criminal cases, defendants have the right to a trial by jury. This means that a group of ordinary citizens decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.Rule of Law: The rule of law is a fundamental principle of English law. It means that everyone, including the government, is subject to the law and no one is above it.These are just a few of the key features of English law, and there are many other aspects that make it unique and interesting.Get a head start on your legal education with our First Year LLB Study Guide."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
