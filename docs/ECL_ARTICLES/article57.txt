Case law refers to the body of legal decisions made by judges in court proceedings. It is also known as common law or judge-made law. These decisions, also called precedents, become part of the legal system and are used as a reference for future cases.In common law legal systems, such as in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, judges are responsible for interpreting and applying the law. When judges make decisions in court, they rely on the facts of the case, the arguments presented by the parties, and legal principles established in previous cases. These decisions are recorded in written opinions, which become part of the body of case law.One of the fundamental principles of case law is the doctrine of stare decisis, which means "to stand by things decided." This principle requires judges to follow and apply the legal principles established in previous cases, especially those from higher courts. This ensures consistency and predictability in the legal system.Case law covers a wide range of legal issues, from criminal law and tort law to constitutional law and administrative law. It provides guidance for judges, lawyers, and citizens on how to interpret and apply the law. Case law is constantly evolving as new cases are decided, and it plays a critical role in shaping the law of a particular jurisdiction.Overall, case law is an essential component of the common law legal system, providing a rich source of legal precedent and guidance for future cases.You can learn more about this topic with our Legal System and Method notes."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
