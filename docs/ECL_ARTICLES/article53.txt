Primary legislation refers to the laws that are created by a legislative body, such as a parliament or congress. These laws are typically the most important and influential laws in a legal system, as they have the power to establish new legal rights, obligations, and prohibitions.Primary legislation is also sometimes referred to as statute law or acts of parliament in some countries. These laws are usually created through a formal legislative process that involves the introduction of a bill, its debate and approval by the legislative body, and its subsequent signing into law by the head of state or other authorised person.Examples of primary legislation include criminal codes, civil codes, taxation laws, labor laws, and environmental protection laws. These laws typically provide the legal framework for how individuals and organisations should behave within a society and the consequences of violating them.Primary legislation is usually considered superior to other types of laws, such as secondary legislation (also known as delegated legislation) and common law. This is because primary legislation is created by the highest law-making authority in a country and can only be changed or repealed by a similarly high level of authority.Get a head start on your legal education with our First Year LLB Study Guide."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
