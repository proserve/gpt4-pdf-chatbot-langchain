The criminal courts of England and Wales deal with criminal offences committed by individuals or organisations. Here is an overview of the main criminal courts in England and Wales:Magistrates' Court: This court is the lowest level of the criminal court hierarchy and deals with summary offences, which are less serious criminal offences such as minor assaults, traffic violations, and some types of theft.Crown Court: This court deals with more serious criminal offences, such as rape, murder, and serious fraud. Cases are heard by a judge and a jury, and if the defendant is found guilty, the judge will impose a sentence.Court of Appeal (Criminal Division): This court hears appeals from the Crown Court and considers whether the conviction was safe or not. The court can quash a conviction, order a retrial, or uphold the conviction and sentence.Supreme Court: This court is the final court of appeal in all criminal cases in the UK. It can hear appeals on points of law or when a matter of general public importance arises.In addition to these main criminal courts, there are also specialised courts and tribunals that deal with specific types of offences or offenders, such as the Youth Court for offenders under 18, the Magistrates' Court for youth cases, and the Crown Court for serious youth cases.Get a head start on your legal education with our First Year LLB Study Guide."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
