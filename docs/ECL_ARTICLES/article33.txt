The Magistrates' Court of England and Wales is a criminal court that deals with less serious criminal offences, such as traffic violations, minor assaults, and thefts. Family magistrates are responsible for some family law matters, such as adoption and child welfare in the Family Court.Magistrates' Courts are located throughout England and Wales and are presided over by magistrates, who are volunteer judges without legal qualifications. They are appointed by the Lord Chancellor and work in panels of three, known as a bench. Magistrates are supported by a legal adviser who provides guidance on points of law and procedure.In the Magistrates' Court, cases are usually heard without a jury, and the magistrate decides on guilt or innocence based on the evidence presented by the prosecution and defence. Magistrates also have the power to impose sentences on convicted defendants, including fines, community service, and custodial sentences of up to six months for a single offence, or up to 12 months for multiple offences.Magistrates' Courts play an important role in the criminal justice system by dealing with the majority of criminal cases in England and Wales. They are intended to provide a swift and cost-effective means of resolving less serious criminal offences, while also giving local communities a say in the administration of justice.Get a head start on your legal education with our First Year LLB Study Guide."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
