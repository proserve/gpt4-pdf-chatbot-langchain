Common law is a legal system that originated in England during the Middle Ages. Its origins can be traced back to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, when William the Conqueror imposed his own system of law on the country. This system was based on the principles of custom and tradition, and it was enforced by the king's courts.Over time, the king's courts developed a body of legal decisions based on the customs and traditions of the people. These decisions were recorded and became known as "case law," and they formed the basis of the common law system.The common law system evolved over many centuries, with judges building upon and refining the decisions of their predecessors. This process of legal evolution was driven by the need to resolve disputes and to adapt to changing social and economic conditions.One of the key factors that contributed to the development of the common law system was the use of juries to decide questions of fact. This allowed ordinary people to participate in the legal process and helped to ensure that the law was grounded in the values and customs of the community.Today, the common law system is used in many countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and India, among others. While the system has evolved over time, it remains rooted in the principles of precedent and the use of juries to decide questions of fact.Get a head start on your legal education with our First Year LLB Study Guide."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
