Secondary legislation, also known as delegated legislation, refers to the laws that are created by government agencies, ministers, or other bodies that have been given the authority to do so by the primary legislation. These laws are often used to fill in the details of primary legislation or to implement specific policies and regulations.Secondary legislation is created through a less formal process than primary legislation, often through regulations, orders, or bylaws. However, it still has the force of law and can impose legal obligations on individuals and organisations.Examples of secondary legislation include environmental regulations, building codes, and health and safety standards. These laws are created to implement specific policies and regulations that are authorised by the primary legislation.While secondary legislation is subordinate to primary legislation, it still plays an important role in the legal system by providing specific details on how the primary legislation is to be implemented. In some cases, secondary legislation can also be challenged in court if it is found to be inconsistent with the primary legislation or with the constitution.Get a head start on your legal education with our First Year LLB Study Guide."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
