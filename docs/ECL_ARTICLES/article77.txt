The Human Rights Act 1998 is a piece of legislation that has a significant impact on UK law and society.Â It ensures that individuals in the UK have their human rights protected and can enforce them in UK courts.The Human Rights Act 1998 was introduced to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into UK law. The ECHR is an international treaty that sets out fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, the right to a fair trial, and the right to freedom of expression. By incorporating the Convention into UK law, the Act ensured that individuals in the UK could enforce their human rights in UK courts, rather than having to go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.The Act has several key provisions. Firstly, it incorporates the ECHR into UK law, which means that UK courts must take the Convention into account when making decisions. Secondly, it creates a duty on public authorities to respect and protect human rights. This means that public authorities, such as the police and government bodies, must ensure that their actions do not violate human rights. Thirdly, the Act allows individuals to bring legal proceedings against public authorities if their human rights have been violated. Finally, it gives UK courts the power to declare that UK law is incompatible with the Convention, and for Parliament to amend the law accordingly.The impact of the Human Rights Act has been significant. It has allowed individuals to bring cases against public authorities where their human rights have been violated. For example, in the case of A v Secretary of State for the Home Department 2004, the Human Rights Act was used to challenge the government's policy of detaining foreign prisoners in Belmarsh without trial. The court found that this policy violated the right to liberty, and the government was forced to change its policy.The Act has also had a broader impact on UK law and society. It has encouraged public authorities to take human rights into account when making decisions, and has led to changes in UK law. For example, in the case of A and Others v the UK 2009, the court declared that the government's policy of detaining prisoners indefinitely under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 was incompatible with the Convention. This led to a change in government policy and the repeal of the 2001 Act with the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011.However, the Human Rights Act has also been the subject of criticism. Some argue that it has given too much power to the judiciary, as judges can declare UK law to be incompatible with the Convention and require Parliament to amend the law. Others argue that it has undermined parliamentary sovereignty, as it allows judges to strike down laws made by Parliament. Additionally, there has been debate around the Act's impact on immigration and national security, with some arguing that it has made it more difficult to deport individuals who pose a threat to national security.In conclusion, the Human Rights Act 1998 is a significant piece of legislation that has had a major impact on UK law and society. While it has faced criticism, its incorporation of the ECHR into UK law has ensured that individuals in the UK have their human rights protected and can enforce them in UK courts. The Act has also led to changes in UK law, and has encouraged public authorities to take human rights into account when making decisions.You can learn more about this topic with our Constitutional Law and Public Law notes."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
