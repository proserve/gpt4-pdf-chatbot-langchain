A statute is a written law passed by a legislative body, such as a national or state parliament, that is formally enacted and enforced by the government. Statutes can cover a wide range of topics, such as criminal law, tax law, environmental law, and family law, among others. They are often enacted to provide a framework of rules and regulations to govern behaviour and resolve disputes within a society or a particular jurisdiction.Statutes typically go through a rigorous legislative process, including drafting, discussion, debate, and voting by the legislative body before they become law. Once enacted, they are typically codified in a body of laws and made available to the public. Statutes can be amended or repealed by the same legislative body that passed them, or by a subsequent legislative body, through a similar process.In some legal systems, such as in the United Kingdom and the United States, statutes are considered the highest form of law and take precedence over other types of laws, such as common law or administrative regulations."I am impressed by how the notes are structured to facilitate effective learning.""UOLLB will show you how to study law correctly and quickly.""Studying with UOLLB makes my life as a law student so much easier.""UOLLB professors are true legal educators who teach from students' perspectives.""I never thought that studying law could be that effortless until I started studying with UOLLB.""UOLLB notes are very important law exam guides for open or closed book exams."Get notified of the latest legal updates and job market directly to your inbox.By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
